    It is a programming error to use the separator '\0' with namespace
    triplets (see XML_SetReturnNSTriplet).
 
+   If a namespace separator is chosen that can be part of a URI or
+   part of an XML name, splitting an expanded name back into its
+   1, 2 or 3 original parts on application level in the element handler
+   may end up vulnerable, so these are advised against;  sane choices for
+   a namespace separator are e.g. '\n' (line feed) and '|' (pipe).
+
    Note that Expat does not validate namespace URIs (beyond encoding)
    against RFC 3986 today (and is not required to do so with regard to
    the XML 1.0 namespaces specification) but it may start doing that
