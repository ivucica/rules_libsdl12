Installation should be as simple as doing a ./configure;make install

Use ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install to change the default install
location of /usr/local. I install alsaplayer in my /opt tree so I configure it
as follows:

./configure --prefix=/opt

The alsaplayer binary will then be placed in /opt/bin after the make install.
(it is in /usr/local/bin by default). For a complete list of configure options
run the configure script with --help

GTK2 interface
==============
In order to get AlsaPlayer's GTK2 interface, gtk+ >= 2.8.0 must be installed
in your system with its devel package. For the systray icon to be compiled in,
gtk+ >= 2.10 is required and you must run configure with --enable-systray.

When closing and re-opening the playlist window, you can get the default size 
as defined in the source code instead of the last used size. This is a bug in
gtk+, not in alsaplayer. It have been fixed in gtk+-2.12.


Installing from CVS
===================

If you have a copy of alsaplayer checked out from the CVS, you should run
the bootstrap script to create the autogenerated files. After this step you 
should run configure, and then run make to compile it.


Installing over an existing version
===================================

Since the various plugin API's are still in flux it might be that newer
versions plugins are not compatible with the versions you have currently
installed. It is therefore best to erase everything under
${prefix}/lib/alsaplayer (i.e. /usr/local/lib/alsaplayer) if you get 
errors about invalid versions. If AlsaPlayer exits prematurely with
signal 7 (Bus error) the above might also help.
